# Command: test
#
# Run a a suite of test batches
#
# Synopsis:
#
#     test [dir1] [dir2] ...
#
# Description:
# This shell script can run a suite of tests composed by several shell
# script, organized in a tree of directories. In each of the directories
# (current directory if none given):
#
# - If a file named "$BEFORE_ALL" is present it is executed first
# - If a file named "$BEFORE_EACH" is present it is executed before each test
# - Every file names `*.test` is executed in alphabetical order
# - If a file named "$AFTER_EACH" is present it is executed after each test
# - If a file named "$AFTER_ALL" is present it is executed last
#
# The files are sourced into `test` script so they have access to `test`
# internales and can modify its functioning.
#
# Dependency between test batches (in different directories) can be implemented
# by calling the `run` command inside the needed per- or post- requisite
# script.
#
# Setup of the whol test run can be pu inside a before-all script in the
# first or top-level test batch directory.
#
# Arguments:
# - dirn: a directory into where to search for test scripts
#
# Output:
# The test output format is compatible with TAP specification, revision 12.
#
